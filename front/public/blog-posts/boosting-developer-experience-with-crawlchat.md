description: How CrawlChat makes docs easier to access and improves developer experience.

If you are a developer, you probably know how frustrating it can be to find the right answer in the documentation. You may have questions like:

- “How do I use this API?”
- “What does this error mean?”
- “Is there an example of this feature?”

But instead of getting quick answers, you often end up scrolling through long pages or outdated forum threads. This wastes time, breaks your flow, and sometimes makes you give up altogether.

**CrawlChat** is a tool designed to solve this exact problem.

## What is CrawlChat?

CrawlChat is an AI-powered assistant that reads your documentation, blog posts, GitHub issues, and help pages. It understands the content and turns it into a smart chatbot that developers can talk to.

This means developers don’t have to search anymore—they can just ask.

For example, instead of searching a documentation site for “how to authenticate,” they can simply ask CrawlChat:

> "How do I authenticate?"

And it will reply with a clear, accurate answer—based on your existing documentation.

## Helpful Where Developers Already Are

One of the biggest advantages of CrawlChat is that it works in places where developers already spend their time.

### 1. "Ask AI" Widget on Docs

You can add a small chatbot widget to your documentation website. This widget lets developers ask questions directly, without leaving the page.

It’s fast, easy, and saves a lot of time.

### 2. Discord Support

Many developer communities live on Discord. CrawlChat lets you add a bot to your server that answers questions about your tool or product.

So when a developer has a question in your Discord community, they can ask the bot instead of waiting for a team member to reply. The bot replies instantly with information from your docs.

This improves the community experience and reduces support workload.

### 3. MCP for AI Tools

CrawlChat also supports something called Model Context Protocol (MCP). This lets your documentation power AI tools like code assistants, IDE plugins, or other developer tools.

If you're building something that uses AI to help developers write code, MCP lets you feed your own documentation into it. This gives users better, more accurate help inside their workflow.

## Learn What Developers Need

CrawlChat also helps you understand your users better. It shows what kind of questions people are asking, what answers the AI is giving, and where the documentation might be unclear or missing.

With these insights, you can improve your docs over time, make sure they cover real developer needs, and build a better product.
