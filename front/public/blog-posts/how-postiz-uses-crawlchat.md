[Postiz](https://postiz.com) is an open-source, all-in-one social media management platform that helps creators, businesses, and agencies schedule, publish, and analyze posts across multiple platforms — including X (Twitter), Mastodon, Bluesky, and more.

With both **cloud-hosted and self-hosted** options, Postiz gives users complete control over their content workflows. It’s designed to be collaborative, flexible, and privacy-focused — offering a sleek interface for managing posts, tracking engagement, and even using AI to generate or rewrite content ideas.

As its community and feature set grew rapidly, Postiz became a favorite among developers and open-source enthusiasts who love its transparency and extensibility.

## Why Postiz Needed AI-Powered Support

As Postiz grew, so did its documentation and community. Users needed quick, accurate answers — not long searches through multiple pages. The team wanted an AI assistant on their docs site that could instantly respond to questions and guide users to the right information.

On Discord, self-hosting users often had technical queries about setup, deployment, or scaling. These repetitive questions took time away from the maintainers. Postiz needed a way to handle them automatically, ensuring 24×7 community support across time zones without overwhelming the core team.

## How CrawlChat Solved Those Problems

[CrawlChat](https://crawlchat.app) is an AI engine purpose-built for documentation-based assistants. It crawls a project’s docs, indexes the content, and creates a private, intelligent chatbot that can be embedded anywhere — on websites, apps, or even Discord servers.

Here’s how CrawlChat helped Postiz:

- **Instant doc-based responses:** Users can ask questions in natural language and get answers sourced directly from official documentation.
- **Seamless multi-channel integration:** CrawlChat supports both website embeds and Discord bots, making it easy to unify user support across platforms.
- **Zero maintenance:** Once configured, CrawlChat automatically keeps up with updated documentation — no manual syncing required.
- **Always on:** It provides 24×7 multilingual support, meaning users get accurate help anytime, in their own language.
- **Community insights:** CrawlChat analytics reveal what users are asking, helping Postiz continuously improve their docs.

As Postiz’s Egelhaus shared in a public testimonial:

> “We can definitely recommend using CrawlChat — it’s **easy to set up**, really **affordable**, and has great support. Thank you [@pramodk73](https://x.com/pramodk73) for making this!”

## How Postiz Uses CrawlChat

### Embedded on the Docs Site

Postiz integrated the CrawlChat widget directly on their documentation portal ([docs.postiz.com](https://docs.postiz.com)). Now, any visitor can simply type a question like “How do I connect Mastodon?” or “How do I self-host Postiz with Docker?” — and CrawlChat instantly pulls the right information from the docs.

### Installed on Discord

The team also added the CrawlChat bot to their Discord server. When community members need help, they can simply tag **@crawlchat**, and the bot jumps in to respond using the latest information from the docs.

### Automated Thread Tagging

Postiz took it one step further by automating the support process. They set up another bot that automatically tags **@crawlchat** whenever a new support thread is created. CrawlChat then joins the thread, answers the user’s question, and continues the conversation if the user follows up.

So far, **over 150 support threads** have been handled this way — automatically, accurately, and instantly.

This automation keeps the Discord clean, responsive, and scalable, while freeing up human maintainers to focus on building new features instead of repeating the same troubleshooting steps.

## 24×7 Help, in Every Language

CrawlChat ensures that Postiz users can get help **anytime**, even when maintainers are asleep or busy. Thanks to CrawlChat’s multilingual capabilities, users around the world can interact in their own language — making support more inclusive and effective.

The combination of Postiz’s open-source transparency and CrawlChat’s AI automation creates a model modern communities can learn from:

> Smart, doc-driven, multilingual support that never sleeps.

With CrawlChat, Postiz turned its documentation and Discord into living, interactive spaces — empowering users, strengthening community, and keeping support efficient around the clock.
