# Cursor Rules

## Code Style Guidelines

### Comments
- Do NOT add comments to the code
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Remove any existing comments when modifying code

### Error Handling
- Do NOT use try-catch blocks
- Let errors propagate naturally
- Use proper error handling patterns specific to the framework/library being used

### General Principles
- Write clean, readable code that doesn't require comments
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Prefer explicit error handling over try-catch when possible
